# Chapter 3: Common Programming Concepts

This chapter covers the basic concepts that are common to most programming languages. None of the concepts here are unique to Rust, but it is important to at least have a feeling of what they look like in Rust.

Also, most of the contents in this chapter were already presented or used in the [guessing game](./../02_programming_a_guessing_game/guessing_game/src/main.rs) from the [chapter 2](./../02_programming_a_guessing_game/readme.md). We are now just formalizing their introduction.
