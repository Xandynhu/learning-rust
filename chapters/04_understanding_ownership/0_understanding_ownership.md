# Chapter 4: Understanding Ownership

``Ownership`` is Rust’s most unique feature and has deep implications for the rest of the language. It enables Rust to make ``memory safety guarantees`` without needing a garbage collector.

In this chapter, we’ll learn about ownership as well as several related features: ``borrowing``, ``slices``, and how Rust lays data out in memory.
